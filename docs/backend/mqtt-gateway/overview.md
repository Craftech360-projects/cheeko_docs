# MQTT Gateway Overview

![MQTT Gateway](/img/gateway-header.jpeg)

The MQTT Gateway is a Node.js protocol bridge that sits between ESP32 Cheeko devices and the LiveKit WebRTC cloud. Devices communicate using MQTT over TCP and raw UDP; the gateway translates those into LiveKit room connections and WebRTC audio tracks so the **Go voice agent (picoclaw-livekit)** can talk to children in real time. It also exposes an internal HTTP API (`:8091`) for settings push from the Manager API, and short-circuits **AI Imagine** sessions to the [Imagine server](../../imagine/overview.md) without involving LiveKit.

**MQTT (control messages)**
```
ESP32 Device ──publish──► EMQX Broker ──republish──► internal/server-ingest ──► MQTTGateway
ESP32 Device ◄──subscribe── EMQX Broker ◄──publish── devices/p2p/<clientId> ◄── MQTTGateway
                                            (gateway sends directly, no republish)
```

**UDP (audio)**
```

```

**Per-device internal structure**

## Connection Lifecycle

### 1. Device connects

The ESP32 connects to the **EMQX broker** via MQTT/TCP. The gateway does **not** receive device connections directly — EMQX republishes all device messages to the `internal/server-ingest` topic, which the gateway subscribes to.

The device's MQTT client ID uses the format:

```
GID_test@@@68_25_dd_bb_f3_a0@@@<uuid>
```

Where the three parts separated by `@@@` are the group ID, MAC address (underscores instead of colons), and a UUID.

### 2. Hello message received

EMQX republishes all device messages to `internal/server-ingest`. The gateway receives the message, extracts the MAC address from the client ID, and calls `handleDeviceHello`.

`handleDeviceHello` creates two objects stored in `MQTTGateway`:

| Map | Key | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `connections` | `connectionId` (random 32-bit int) | `VirtualMQTTConnection` instance |
| `deviceConnections` | device MAC address | `{ connectionId, connection }` |

### 3. Fast hello response (< 50 ms)

`VirtualMQTTConnection.parseHelloMessage` immediately:
- Generates a 16-byte AES key (`crypto.randomBytes(16)`) and a 16-byte nonce (from `generateUdpHeader`)
- Generates a `session_id` in the format `<uuid>_<mac>_<roomType>` (default room type: `conversation`)
- Sends a `hello` response back via MQTT on `devices/p2p/<fullClientId>` with UDP connection parameters

### 4. Deferred setup (background)

While the device starts streaming audio, the gateway runs parallel Manager API queries to fetch:
- Room type (`conversation` / `music` / `story`)
- PTT mode (`auto` / `manual`)
- Current character (e.g., `Cheeko`, `Math Tutor`)
- Child profile

After queries complete it:
1. Sends a `mode_update` MQTT message with the actual values
2. Creates a `LiveKitBridge` and connects to a LiveKit room named `<uuid>_<mac>_<roomType>`
3. Dispatches the voice agent via `AgentDispatchClient` — the agent name is the character's `runtimeAgentName` from the Manager API, or `LIVEKIT_DEFAULT_AGENT` (default **`cheeko-agent`**, the Go worker) when unset. There is no per-character agent map anymore; character identity is applied by the worker as a persona.

:::note ai_imagine sessions
If the device hello carries `"feature": "ai_imagine"`, the LiveKit bridge is skipped entirely: decrypted Opus frames are buffered (max ~2 min) and, on `speech_end` / listen-stop, sent to the Imagine server over WebSocket. The resulting image is uploaded to `POST /toy/imagine/upload` and delivered to the device as an MQTT `image` message with a CDN URL (`image_status` while generating, `image_error` with `no_speech` / `safety_block` / `rate_limited` / `generation_failed` on failure).
:::

### 5. Audio streaming

UDP packets arrive at `MQTTGateway.onUdpMessage`. The 16-byte header is parsed to extract the `connectionId`, which looks up the `VirtualMQTTConnection`. The connection decrypts the payload and forwards decoded PCM audio to LiveKit. Audio coming back from LiveKit is encoded to Opus and sent as encrypted UDP to the device.

### 6. Cleanup

When a `goodbye` message is received (or an inactivity timeout fires), `VirtualMQTTConnection.parseOtherMessage` notifies the agent via a LiveKit data channel `disconnect_agent` message, then closes the `LiveKitBridge`. The entries are removed from both gateway maps. Ghost room cleanup also runs every 5 minutes to remove any LiveKit rooms that are empty, have only agents (no device), or are older than 60 minutes.

## Key Data Structures

### VirtualMQTTConnection

One instance per connected device, stored in `MQTTGateway.connections`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `deviceId` | string | Device MAC address (`aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`) |
| `connectionId` | number | Random 32-bit integer, used as UDP cookie |
| `macAddress` | string | Colon-separated MAC |
| `groupId` | string | First segment of MQTT client ID |
| `uuid` | string | Third segment of MQTT client ID |
| `bridge` | `LiveKitBridge` | LiveKit room bridge (null until deferred setup completes) |
| `roomType` | string | `conversation`, `music`, or `story` |
| `udp.key` | Buffer | 16-byte AES-128 encryption key |
| `udp.nonce` | Buffer | 16-byte AES-128-CTR IV |
| `udp.encryption` | string | Always `"aes-128-ctr"` |
| `udp.session_id` | string | LiveKit room name |
| `udp.remoteAddress` | Object | `{ address, port }` of device UDP endpoint |
| `lastActivityTime` | number | Unix ms; used for 2-minute inactivity timeout |
| `sessionStartTime` | number | Unix ms; max session duration 60 minutes |

### LiveKitBridge

One instance per active device session, held by `VirtualMQTTConnection.bridge`.

Connects the gateway as a participant in the LiveKit room, publishes device audio as a track, subscribes to agent audio tracks, and routes data channel messages in both directions.

---

## Settings Sync (internal HTTP API, :8091)

The Manager API pushes device settings through the gateway's internal command server (`gateway/internal-command-server.js`), authenticated with an `X-Service-Key` header (`MANAGER_API_SECRET` or `SERVICE_SECRET_KEY`):

| Method + Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /internal/settings/publish-update` | Publish a `settings_update` MQTT message to a device (body: `{mac_address, sender_client_id, message}`) |
| `POST /internal/settings/ping` | Publish a `settings_ping` |
| `GET /health` | Internal health check |

Responses: `200` published, `202` queued (device has no active route yet), `400` bad/unroutable, `401` unauthorized.

In the other direction, device messages `settings_ack`, `settings_get`, `settings_changed`, `device_state`, and analytics events are forwarded to the Manager API's `/toy/device-sync/*` endpoints.

---

## Running

```bash
cd main/mqtt-gateway
npm install
node app.js
```

---

## Configuration File (`config/mqtt.json`)

The gateway reads MQTT broker and LiveKit credentials from `config/mqtt.json`. The `ConfigManager` watches this file for live-reload — changes take effect without restarting the process.

```json
{
  "debug": false,
  "mqtt_broker": {
    "host": "YOUR_EMQX_HOST",
    "port": 1883,
    "protocol": "mqtt",
    "keepalive": 60,
    "clean": true,
    "reconnectPeriod": 1000,
    "connectTimeout": 30000
  },
  "livekit": {
    "url": "wss://your-project.livekit.cloud",
    "api_key": "YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_KEY",
    "api_secret": "YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `debug` | Enable verbose debug logging |
| `mqtt_broker.host` | EMQX broker hostname or IP |
| `mqtt_broker.port` | EMQX broker port (default 1883) |
| `mqtt_broker.protocol` | `mqtt` (plain) or `mqtts` (TLS) |
| `mqtt_broker.keepalive` | MQTT keepalive interval in seconds |
| `mqtt_broker.clean` | Start with a clean MQTT session |
| `mqtt_broker.reconnectPeriod` | Auto-reconnect interval in ms |
| `mqtt_broker.connectTimeout` | Connection timeout in ms |
| `livekit.url` | LiveKit Cloud WebSocket URL |
| `livekit.api_key` | LiveKit API key |
| `livekit.api_secret` | LiveKit API secret |

Environment variables (`EMQX_HOST`, `LIVEKIT_URL`, etc.) override the corresponding `mqtt.json` values when set.
