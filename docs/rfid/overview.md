# RFID Cards

![RFID Card Scan Flow](/img/RFID_card_scan.jpeg)

RFID cards are physical NFC/RFID cards that children tap on the Cheeko device to instantly trigger AI interactions or content playback. A card tap is the primary non-voice interaction on the device — it replaces typing or menu navigation with a simple physical action a 3-year-old can perform.

Cards fall into three categories:

- **Content cards** — pre-recorded story packs, rhyme packs, and habit packs. Tapping delivers an audio manifest directly to the device. No LiveKit or LLM is involved.
- **Q&A cards** (`prompt` / `prompt_pack`) — a specific question prompt is forwarded to the LiveKit AI agent, which generates a spoken answer. The conversation is question-scoped: the agent answers the prompt, not a free chat.
- **AI conversation cards** — triggers open, unscripted conversation with the AI agent. No prompt text is sent — the card just signals the agent to start an interactive conversation session with the child. (The gateway classifies these by data shape: `contentType: "prompt"` with no content items; the `card_type` DB column is informational.)

## How It Works (Overview)

```
Card tapped on device
    │
    ▼
ESP32 checks SD card cache (cardmap.jsn)
    │
    ├─ Cache hit + manifest exists → play content from SD (offline, no network)
    │
    └─ Cache miss → MQTT card_lookup to gateway
                        │
                        ▼
               Gateway calls Manager API

                        │
                        ▼
               Gateway classifies response by data shape:

## Card Types

| Card Type | `contentType` Value | What It Triggers | Example |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| Story Pack | `story_pack` | Direct audio manifest sent to device; device downloads and plays | "The Hungry Fox" bedtime story series |
| Rhyme Pack | `rhyme_pack` | Direct audio manifest sent to device | Nursery rhyme collection |
| Habit Pack | `habit_pack` | Direct audio manifest sent to device | Morning routine steps with audio |
| Q&A Single | `prompt` | A specific question (`promptText`) sent to the LiveKit agent; agent answers that question | "What does a dog say?" |
| Q&A Pack | `prompt_pack` | One question from a pack (selected by `sequence` number) sent to agent; agent answers it | Animal Friends Q&A pack |
| AI Conversation Card | `prompt`, no items | **No prompt text sent.** With no active session the gateway sends `card_ai` (may include `agent_name`) and the device prewarms the conversation channel; with an active conversation it switches character or routes the prompt | Cheeko character card, Math Tutor card |
| Bulk Range | `prompt` (series) | Card UID falls within a numeric range mapped to a question | Flashcard sets |

The gateway classifies content cards and Q&A cards using **data-shape detection** — it looks for `audioUrl` vs `promptText` in the returned items array, not by matching the `contentType` string. This means any new content type added to the backend is automatically handled.

## Full Card Scan Flow

### 1. Device Side

When a child taps an RFID card:

1. The RFID reader on the ESP32 reads the card's UID (hex string, e.g. `E96C8A82`).
2. The firmware checks the SD card file `/sdcard/cheeko/cardmap.jsn` for a cached mapping.
   - If the UID is in the cache AND the file `/sdcard/cheeko/skills/<skill_id>/manifest.jsn` exists, the device plays content from SD immediately — no network required.
   - If the UID is not cached or the download is incomplete, the device sends a `card_lookup` (or `text_greeting`) MQTT message to the gateway.
3. The firmware waits up to 10 seconds for a response. If no response arrives, it shows a "card not recognized" UI state.

**MQTT message published by device:**

```json
{"session_id": "uuid-abc123", "type": "card_lookup", "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4"}
```

Some firmware versions send `start_greeting_text` instead of `card_lookup`. The gateway handles these two message types identically (a third variant, `text_greeting`, is **not** matched by the gateway's routing).

```json
{
  "type": "start_greeting_text",
  "rfid_uid": "E96C8A82",
  "sequence": 1,
  "timestamp": 1710000000000
}
```

Fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | `card_lookup` or `start_greeting_text` |
| `rfid_uid` | string | yes | Hex UID of the scanned card |
| `sequence` | integer | no | For Q&A packs: which question to use (defaults to 1) |
| `session_id` | string | no | Active session ID if a conversation is in progress |
| `timestamp` | integer | no | Unix milliseconds |

---

### 2. Gateway Processing

The MQTT Gateway (`mqtt-gateway.js`) receives the card scan message and:

1. Extracts `rfid_uid` from the payload (also checks `rfidUid`, `sl_no`, `seq` for legacy field names).
2. Calls the Manager API:
   ```
   GET /toy/admin/rfid/card/lookup/{rfidUid}
   ```
3. Inspects the response body using data-shape detection:
   ```javascript
   const hasItems = Array.isArray(items) && items.length > 0;
   const isContentPack = hasItems && items.some(item => item.audioUrl);
   const isQaPack     = hasItems && !isContentPack && items.some(item => item.promptText);
   ```
4. Routes to the appropriate branch (see steps 4 and 5 below).

If the Manager API returns 404 or null, the gateway sends a `card_unknown` message back to the device.

---

### 3. Manager API Lookup

**Endpoint:** `GET /toy/admin/rfid/card/lookup/:rfidUid`

The UID is normalized before lookup: uppercased and stripped of colons/dashes (`04:A1:B2` becomes `04A1B2`).

The lookup follows a priority chain:

1. Exact match in `rfid_card_mapping` where `active = true`.
2. If no exact match: bulk range lookup in `rfid_series` where `start_uid <= uid <= end_uid`.
3. If no match in either table: returns null (404).

**For a matched card, the response depends on what the mapping links to:**

**Content Pack response** (`items` have `audioUrl`):

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "success",
  "data": {
    "rfid_uid": "12345678",
    "contentType": "story_pack",
    "title": "Bedtime Stories",
    "packCode": "BEDTIME_01",
    "version": 1,
    "items": [
      {
        "sequence": 1,
        "title": "The Sleepy Bear",
        "audioUrl": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/track_01.mp3",
        "imageUrl": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/thumb_01.png",
        "promptText": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Q&A Pack response** (`items` have `promptText`):

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "success",
  "data": {
    "rfid_uid": "E96C8A82",
    "contentType": "prompt_pack",
    "packCode": "ANIMALS_QA",
    "packName": "Animal Friends Q&A",
    "items": [
      {
        "sequence": 1,
        "title": "Tell me about dogs",
        "promptText": "Tell me what you know about dogs. What sound does a dog make?",
        "audioUrl": null,
        "allowCaching": true,
        "systemPromptOverride": null
      },
      {
        "sequence": 2,
        "title": "What do you know about cats?",
        "promptText": "What do you know about cats? How does a cat say hello?",
        "audioUrl": null,
        "allowCaching": true,
        "systemPromptOverride": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Card not found response:**

```
HTTP 404
{"code": 1, "msg": "Card mapping not found", "data": null}
```

---

### 4. Gateway Response to Device

After classifying the Manager API response, the gateway sends one of the following MQTT messages to the device's P2P topic (`devices/p2p/{clientId}`):

**card_unknown** — No mapping found:

```json
{"type": "card_unknown", "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4"}
```

**card_ai** — AI/prompt card with no active session (may include `agent_name`):

```json
{"type": "card_ai", "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4", "agent_name": "cheeko-agent"}
```

**card_up_to_date** — sent when the card-tap handshake (`POST /toy/admin/rfid/card/tap`) reports the device's cached content is already current; no manifest follows.

**card_content / download_response** — Content pack found (stories, rhymes, habits):

For new firmware, the gateway sends `card_content`:

```json
{
  "type": "card_content",
  "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4",
  "skill_id": "skill_abc123",
  "skill_name": "The Hungry Fox Story",
  "version": 1,
  "audio": [
    {"index": 1, "url": "https://s3.example.com/audio/track1.mp3"},
    {"index": 2, "url": "https://s3.example.com/audio/track2.mp3"}
  ],
  "images": [
    {"index": 1, "url": "https://s3.example.com/images/page1.jpg"},
    {"index": 2, "url": "https://s3.example.com/images/page2.jpg"}
  ]
}
```

For backward compatibility the gateway also sends `download_response` format:

```json
{
  "type": "download_response",
  "status": "download_required",
  "rfid_uid": "12345678",
  "pack_code": "BEDTIME_01",
  "pack_name": "Bedtime Stories",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "total_items": 2,
  "files": {
    "audio_1": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/track_01.mp3",
    "image_1": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/thumb_01.png",
    "audio_2": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/track_02.mp3",
    "image_2": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/thumb_02.png"
  }
}
```

Published to topic: `devices/p2p/{clientId}`

No LiveKit connection is required for content pack delivery. The gateway returns immediately after publishing.

---

### 5. AI Agent Behavior

For Q&A cards and AI cards, the gateway forwards a `user_text` message to the LiveKit agent via the data channel:

```json
{
  "type": "user_text",
  "text": "Tell me what you know about dogs. What sound does a dog make?",
  "device_id": "00:16:3E:AC:B5:38",
  "session_id": "uuid-session-abc",
  "source": "rfid",
  "rfid_uid": "E96C8A81",
  "sequence": 1,
  "content_type": "prompt",
  "audio_url": null,
  "system_prompt_override": null,
  "timestamp": 1738320000000
}
```

:::caution Current gap
The behaviors below were implemented by the **retired Python worker** (`cheeko_worker.py`). The current Go voice agent (picoclaw-livekit) has **no `user_text` handler**, so Q&A prompt injection is presently not consumed on the agent side:

- If `audio_url` is present and non-null, the agent could play the cached audio instead of generating a new response via TTS.
- If `system_prompt_override` is present, the agent used it as the system prompt for this interaction only.
- If `allow_caching` is true, the agent saved the generated audio to S3 and updated `cached_audio_url` for future taps.
- The agent did not change its conversation mode or character based on the card tap.
:::

**AI card prewarm flow:**

When the device receives `card_ai`, the firmware preemptively opens a LiveKit channel so it is ready when the child speaks:

```
card_ai received
    │
    ├─ Already connected (hello sent) → keep channel open, mark as prewarmed
    │
    └─ Not connected → send hello → wait for server hello → open UDP → stay in prewarm state
                                         │
                                         └─ User presses button or speaks wake word
                                              → conversation starts from prewarmed state (low latency)
```

---

## Card Management (Admin Dashboard)

Card management is done exclusively through the admin dashboard (`manager-web`). There is no mobile app RFID management — the parent mobile app does not expose card CRUD operations.

### Adding a New Card

1. In the admin dashboard, navigate to **RFID** → **Card Mappings**.
2. Click **Add Card**.
3. Enter the **RFID UID** — the hex string from the physical card (e.g. `E96C8A82`). Colons and dashes are stripped automatically on save.
4. Set the **Card Type**: `content` for story/rhyme/habit cards, `ai` for open conversation cards.
5. Link the card to one of:
   - A **Content Pack** (for stories, rhymes, habits) — select from the Content Pack dropdown.
   - A **Question Pack** (for Q&A sequences) — select from the Question Pack dropdown.
   - A **Single Question** — select a single prompt from the Question dropdown.
6. Set **Active** to enabled.
7. Save.

The UID is checked for duplicates on creation. A UID can only be assigned to one mapping.

### Binding a Card to Content

**Content card (stories, rhymes, habits):**

1. First create a **Content Pack** under RFID → Content Packs.
2. Add up to 10 **Content Items** to the pack, each with a title, audio URL (S3), and optional image URL.
3. Return to Card Mappings and link the card to the Content Pack.

**Q&A card (single question):**

1. Create a **Question** under RFID → Questions with a `prompt_text` and optional `cached_audio_url`.
2. In Card Mappings, set `question_id` to link the card to that question.

**Q&A card (question pack with sequence):**

1. Create a **Question Pack** under RFID → Question Packs.
2. Add questions to the pack's `question_ids` array (up to 10).
3. Link the card to the Question Pack. The device sends a `sequence` number (1-based) to select which question to use on each tap.

**Bulk range (series):**

1. Create a **Series** under RFID → Series with a `start_uid` and `end_uid`.
2. Link the series to a Question and optionally a Pack (physical SKU). Any card whose UID falls lexicographically between `start_uid` and `end_uid` resolves to the linked question.

### Card Fields

The `rfid_card_mapping` table stores the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | BIGINT PK | Auto-generated |
| `rfid_uid` | VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE | Physical card UID, uppercased, no separators |
| `question_id` | BIGINT FK | Links to a single `rfid_question` |
| `question_pack_id` | BIGINT FK | Links to an `rfid_question_pack` |
| `question_ids` | JSON array | Question IDs stored directly on the mapping (alternative to question_pack_id) |
| `pack_code` | VARCHAR | Physical product SKU code |
| `pack_id` | BIGINT FK | Links to `rfid_pack` (physical product) |
| `content_pack_id` | BIGINT FK | Links to `rfid_content_pack` (highest priority in lookup) |
| `action_type` | VARCHAR(50) | `content` or `qna` |
| `action_data` | JSON | Arbitrary extra data |
| `card_type` | VARCHAR | `content`, `ai`, or null |
| `notes` | TEXT | Admin notes |
| `active` | BOOLEAN | Whether the card mapping is enabled |
| `status` | INTEGER | `1` = active, `0` = inactive (legacy field) |
| `create_date` | TIMESTAMP | |
| `update_date` | TIMESTAMP | |

**Priority rule:** `content_pack_id` is checked first. If a card has both `content_pack_id` and `card_type = 'ai'`, the content pack wins. This prevents misconfigured cards from accidentally firing the AI flow.

## Smart Routing: Gateway Classification Logic

The gateway uses data-shape detection to classify lookup results. This logic lives in `mqtt-gateway.js` and runs on every card scan:

```javascript
// Data-shape detection (not string matching on contentType)
const hasItems = Array.isArray(items) && items.length > 0;
const isContentPack = hasItems && items.some(item => item.audioUrl);    // Pre-recorded audio
const isQaPack     = hasItems && !isContentPack && items.some(item => item.promptText); // LLM prompts
```

| Condition | Branch | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `isContentPack = true` | Branch A | Build `download_response` manifest; send via MQTT; no LiveKit |
| `isQaPack = true` | Branch B | Find item by `sequence`; forward `promptText` to LiveKit agent |
| No items, top-level `promptText` | Branch C | Forward top-level `promptText` to LiveKit agent |
| Null response from API | — | Send `card_unknown` to device |

**Branch B sequence selection:**

1. Look for item with `sequence` matching the value sent by the device.
2. Fall back to item at index 0 if the requested sequence is not found.
3. Extract `promptText`. If `audioUrl` is non-null on that item, include it so the agent can skip TTS generation.

---

## Card Caching on Device (SD Card)

The device maintains a local cache to enable offline playback and reduce network latency.

**Cache files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/sdcard/cheeko/cardmap.jsn` | Maps RFID UIDs to `skill_id` values |
| `/sdcard/cheeko/skills/<skill_id>/manifest.jsn` | Completion marker; presence means download is complete |
| `/sdcard/cheeko/skills/<skill_id>/audio/track<n>.mp3` | Downloaded audio tracks |
| `/sdcard/cheeko/skills/<skill_id>/images/page<n>.jpg` | Downloaded images |

**Cache hit flow:**

```
Card tapped
    │
    ▼
Read cardmap.jsn → UID found → skill_id = "skill_abc123"
    │
    ▼
Check /sdcard/cheeko/skills/skill_abc123/manifest.jsn
    │
    ├─ Exists → play from SD immediately (no network)
    │
    └─ Missing (incomplete download) → treat as cache miss → send card_lookup
```

**Cache write flow** (after receiving `card_content` / `download_response`):

1. Create `/sdcard/cheeko/skills/<skill_id>/` directory.
2. Download each `audio_N` URL to `/sdcard/cheeko/skills/<skill_id>/audio/track<n>.mp3`.
3. Download each `image_N` URL to `/sdcard/cheeko/skills/<skill_id>/images/page<n>.jpg`.
4. Write `manifest.jsn` **last** — this is the completion marker. A missing manifest means the download is incomplete.
5. Update `cardmap.jsn` with the new `uid → skill_id` entry.

If the card is removed during download, the firmware aborts the download and does not auto-play when the download finishes.

## MQTT Message Reference

### card_lookup (Device to Gateway)

Sent when a card UID is not in the device's SD cache.

```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid-session-abc",
  "type": "card_lookup",
  "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4"
}
```

Alternative forms also accepted by gateway (`text_greeting`, `start_greeting_text`):

```json
{
  "type": "text_greeting",
  "rfid_uid": "E96C8A82",
  "sequence": 1,
  "timestamp": 1710000000000
}
```

### card_unknown (Gateway to Device)

Sent when the Manager API returns no mapping for the scanned UID.

```json
{
  "type": "card_unknown",
  "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4"
}
```

Firmware behavior: display "card not recognized" UI state.

### card_ai (Gateway to Device)

Sent when the card is mapped as an AI conversation card.

```json
{
  "type": "card_ai",
  "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4"
}
```

Firmware behavior:
1. Store UID to AI mapping locally.
2. If device is idle: begin prewarming the conversation channel (send `hello` if not already connected).
3. On user action (button press or wake word): start conversation from the prewarmed state.
4. On card removal: cancel prewarm; do not enter deep sleep while prewarmed.

### card_content (Gateway to Device)

Sent when the card maps to a content pack (story, rhyme, habit). New firmware format.

```json
{
  "type": "card_content",
  "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4",
  "skill_id": "skill_abc123",
  "skill_name": "The Hungry Fox Story",
  "version": 1,

### download_response (Gateway to Device)

Legacy format for backward compatibility. Carries the same information as `card_content` in a flat `files` object. New firmware should use `card_content` instead.

```json
{
  "type": "download_response",
  "status": "download_required",
  "rfid_uid": "12345678",
  "pack_code": "BEDTIME_01",
  "pack_name": "Bedtime Stories",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "total_items": 2,
  "files": {
    "audio_1": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/track_01.mp3",
    "image_1": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/thumb_01.png",
    "audio_2": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/track_02.mp3",
    "image_2": "https://s3.example.com/bedtime/thumb_02.png"
  }
}
```

Other `status` values for `download_response`:

```json
{"type": "download_response", "status": "not_found", "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4"}
{"type": "download_response", "status": "up_to_date", "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4", "pack_code": "fox_story", "version": "2"}
{"type": "download_response", "status": "error", "rfid_uid": "04A1B2C3D4", "message": "Server error"}
```

### user_text (Gateway to LiveKit Agent — internal)

Not sent to the device. The gateway forwards this to the LiveKit agent via the data channel when a **Q&A card** is scanned (carrying the `promptText`). For **AI conversation cards**, no `user_text` is forwarded — the agent simply starts an open conversation when the child speaks.

```json
{
  "type": "user_text",
  "text": "Tell me what you know about dogs. What sound does a dog make?",
  "device_id": "00:16:3E:AC:B5:38",
  "session_id": "uuid-session-abc",
  "source": "rfid",
  "rfid_uid": "E96C8A81",
  "sequence": 1,
  "content_type": "prompt",
  "audio_url": null,
  "system_prompt_override": null,
  "timestamp": 1738320000000
}
```

## Adding Cards from the Mobile App

The Cheeko parent mobile app does not include RFID card management. Card creation, editing, and deletion is done exclusively through the admin dashboard (`manager-web`). Parents cannot register new cards from the app.
